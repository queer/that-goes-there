# that goes there

*that goes there* (hereafter "there" or `there`) is:

- A library for general planning and execution of tasks on local and remote
  hosts.
  - [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/there)
  - Tasks are compiled down to `sh(1)`-compatible commands for execution.
  - Non-raw-command tasks attempt to validate prerequists before execution.
- A CLI for applying plans via:
  - Local execution
  - Remote SSH
  - Agent-controller SSH
- An agent-controller pair for remote SSH execution.

Minimum supported Rust version: `1.66`

## features

### Library:

- Tokio-based, fully-async
- Pluggable execution backends
  - [x] Local
  - [x] SSH
  - [ ] Implement `Executor` yourself!
- Async log streaming
- Pluggable log streaming backends
  - [x] In-memory
  - [ ] Implement `LogSource`/`LogSink` yourself!
- Agent-controller shared IPC structs
- Plan validation
  - Compile tasks down to `sh(1)`-compatible commands
- Host files + host groups
- Fully instrumented with `tracing::instrument`
  - `tracing`-based logging that can be consumed with `tracing-subscriber`
  - `color_eyre`-based error reporting
    - Used to share error implementation between CLI/agent/controller

### CLI:

- Log streaming by default
  - [x] Local execution
  - [x] SSH execution
  - [x] Agent-controller execution
- Plan validation

## setup

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
cargo install cargo-audit
```

## usage

kinda undocumented for now. refer to `test/*.yaml` for some plan/hostfile
examples.

## todo

- [ ] Pretty tui with [makeup](https://crates.io/crates/makeup) for log streaming
- [ ] Concurrency guards to ensure that certain tasks have to run across all
      hosts at the same time.
